<h2>The story</h2>

<p>
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate.
    They said, <q class="villagers">We are soy to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer
    said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
    said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky.
    What a great turn of events.Maybe You now eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too
    <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>
    </q>, and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q> The next day
    the conscription
    officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
    Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether
    anything that happens in it is
    <tag attribute="good">good</tag>
    or
    <tag attribute="bad">bad</tag>
    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
    or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.
